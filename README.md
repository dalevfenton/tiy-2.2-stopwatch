#Javascript Stopwatch
Challenge: create a stopwatch that keeps time between start and stopwatch
Challenge 2: allow the user to reset the stopwatch
Challenge 3: add a lap button that tracks the split since last lap

This project was completed in one morning / afternoon coding session. The
design and layout are based on the stopwatch found on Android devices. The
stopwatch can be found live here: http://dalevfenton.github.io/tiy-2.2-stopwatch/
